## 💾 Data Structures C Programs (Engineering Semester 3)

This repository contains my collection of **C programming language** implementations for fundamental **Data Structures**, created as part of my **Engineering Semester 3** curriculum.

These programs cover the essential concepts and algorithms used in computer science to efficiently organize and manage data.

### ✨ Key Features

  * **Core Data Structures:** Implementations of common structures like Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, and various algorithms.
  * **C Language:** All programs are written in the C programming language.
  * **Educational Focus:** Demonstrates practical understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts.

### 📂 Repository Contents

The table below lists the files found in this repository, corresponding to the C source files shown in your screenshot, along with a brief description of the data structure or algorithm implemented in each:

| Filename | Data Structure / Algorithm Implemented | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `binary.c` | **Binary Tree** | Implementation of a basic **Binary Tree** data structure and its core operations. |
| `dictionary.c` | **Dictionary using BST** | Implementation of a **Dictionary** Abstract Data Type (ADT) using a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** for key-value storage. |
| `huffman.c` | **Huffman Coding** | Implementation of the **Huffman compression algorithm**. |
| `queue.c` | **Queue** | Implementation of the **Queue** data structure (FIFO - First In, First Out). |
| `sll.c` | **Singly Linked List (SLL)** | Implementation of basic **Singly Linked List** operations (insertion, deletion, traversal). |
| `sort.c` | **Multiple Sorting Algorithms** | Includes implementations of **Bubble Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, and **Selection Sort** algorithms in a single file. |
| `sparse.c` | **Sparse Matrix Operations** | Implementation of the **Sparse Matrix** representation, including **Simple Transpose** and **Fast Transpose** algorithms. |
| `stack.c` | **Stack** | Implementation of the **Stack** data structure (LIFO - Last In, First Out). |
| `thread.c` | **Threaded Binary Tree (TBT)** | Implementation of the **Threaded Binary Tree** to facilitate efficient in-order traversal without an explicit stack. |

### 🚀 Getting Started

These programs are written in standard C and can be compiled and run using any standard C compiler (like GCC).

#### **Prerequisites**

You will need a C compiler installed on your system.

  * **Windows/Linux/macOS:** [GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)](https://gcc.gnu.org/) is highly recommended.

#### **Compiling and Running**

Follow these steps for a typical program, using `stack.c` as an example:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aradhya0507/Data-Structures.git
    ```
2.  **Compile the file:**
    ```bash
    gcc stack.c -o stack
    ```
3.  **Run the executable:**
    ```bash
    ./stack
    ```
    *(Note: On Windows, you would typically run `stack.exe`)*
